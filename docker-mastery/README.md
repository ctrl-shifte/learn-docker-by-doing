## 📚 Additional Resources

Each level includes:
- 📖 **README.md** - Challenge instructions
- 🎯 **OBJECTIVES.md** - Learning goals
- 💡 **HINTS.md** - Stuck? Progressive hints here
- ✅ **SOLUTION.md** - Complete solutions (don't peek!)
- 🧪 **TEST.md** - How to verify it works

---

## 🎓 Learning Strategy

### For Each Level:

1. **Read the README** (5-10 min)
2. **Plan your approach** (10-15 min)
   - What services do you need?
   - What Dockerfiles are required?
   - How will services communicate?
3. **Build incrementally** (80% of time)
   - One service at a time
   - Test as you go
   - Don't try to do everything at once!
4. **Debug and optimize** (remaining time)
   - Check image sizes
   - Optimize layer caching
   - Add health checks
5. **Compare to solution** (after you've tried!)

### Pro Tips:
- ⏰ **Time-box your struggle:** Stuck for 30+ min? Check hints!
- 📝 **Take notes:** Document what you learn
- 🔄 **Iterate:** First make it work, then make it good
- 🤝 **Ask for help:** If really stuck, explain your approach and ask specific questions
- 🎯 **Focus on concepts:** Don't just copy-paste, understand WHY
