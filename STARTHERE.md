- Understand layer caching
- Simple Node.js API + PostgreSQL
- **Perfect for:** Getting comfortable with Docker basics

### 📗 LEVEL 2: Blog Platform (4-6 hours) ⭐⭐
**Production Patterns**
- Multi-stage builds
- Development vs Production configs
- 5 services: Frontend (React) + API (Node.js) + PostgreSQL + Redis + Nginx
- Hot-reload development
- Image optimization
- **Perfect for:** Real-world multi-tier applications

### 📕 LEVEL 3: E-Commerce (8-15 hours) ⭐⭐⭐
**Microservices Beast Mode**
- 9+ services across 3 languages (Go, Python, Node.js)
- Multiple databases (PostgreSQL + MongoDB)
- Message queue (RabbitMQ)
- API Gateway (Nginx)
- Production-grade architecture
- **Perfect for:** Mastering complex distributed systems

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Extract the Files
```bash
unzip docker-mastery-complete.zip
cd docker-mastery
```

### Step 2: Read the Overview
```bash
# Quick overview
cat QUICKSTART.md

# Full details
cat README.md

# See what's included
cat PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
```

### Step 3: Start Level 1
```bash
cd level-1-todo-api
cat QUICKSTART.md

# Create your first Dockerfile
# Answer these 4 questions:
# 1. What runtime? (Node.js)
# 2. What to build? (npm install)
# 3. What to run? (code + deps)
# 4. How to start? (node server.js)
```
